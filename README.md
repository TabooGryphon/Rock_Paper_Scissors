# Rock_Paper_Scissors

## Project Goal
The goal for this project was to create a RPS (Rock Paper Scissors) game on a server so it could be played by multiple players.
Once that was accomplished the next step was to make it possible for only two players to play with more on the server.

## Challenges
This project had many challenges, with most of them being small. However, since this was the largest and most complex project I have worked on to this point, I realized that they all add up and can overwhelm you if you don't debug them in a systematic manner. The biggest challenge for me besides that was having each client be able to store data in an organized way and then having the chosen client or clients be the only ones to act from an event.

## What I learned
The largest and best lesson that I learned during this project is that the better organized the code the easier it is to debug and for others to understand it. Also a systematic approach to writing and debugging makes everything smoother and easier. I feel the previous lessons are the primary lessons and the secondary lessons would be how to use NPM and its features.
